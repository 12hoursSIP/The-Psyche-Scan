# The Psyche Scan

**The Psyche Scan** is a minimalist, interactive psychological experience designed to map the "colors" of your social identity. Through a series of 10 clinical-narrative chapters, it analyzes how you project yourself to the world versus how you regulate your internal landscape.

## ✨ The Experience
The journey begins in silence and shadows. As you navigate various social and introspective scenarios, the background and interface react to your choices in real-time. The final reveal uses liquid mesh gradients and dynamic data visualization to present your "Social DNA."

## 🧪 Psychological Dimensions
The scan measures three primary indices:
* **Vitality Index (Gold):** Measures social metabolism, energy projection, and group-cohesion facilitation.
* **Cognitive Innovation (Violet):** Measures internal complexity, visionary depth, and abstract processing.
* **Emotional Stability (Azure):** Measures self-regulation, environmental observation, and boundary maintenance.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5 & CSS3 with GPU-accelerated mesh animations.
* **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript with a custom Localization (i18n) engine.
* **Visuals:** Conic-gradient rendering, glassmorphism, and 3D parallax effects.
* **Multilingual:** Supports English, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese.
